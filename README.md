"Here is completion of my task assigned to me for the UI/UX internship at Coding Samurai. During this internship, they assigned me 3 tasks and instructed me to do any one task. So I selected one task named as the redesign of Brand Cafe. In this phase, I am doing 5 pages by following us:

- Welcome Page
- Home Page
- Coffee Detail Page
- Order Page
- Track Page

During this internship, I utilized my knowledge and skills in an efficient way to do this project. Once again, I thank @CodingSamurai for giving me this internship opportunity to showcase my skills."
